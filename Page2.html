                <p>Did you know that the San Diego Zoo is one of four zoos in the U.S. which has had giant pandas
                on display, and had been the most successful in terms of panda reproduction. The first two giant panda
                cubs in U.S. history to have been born in the U.S. and survive into adulthood. First one born was Hua Mei
                on August 21, 1999. The second born was Mei Sheng on August 19, 2003.</p> <br>

            <p> In April of 2019 the pandas had been repatriated to China after successfully serving its conservation misson.
                The San Diego Zoo is happy to welcome Yun Chuan, a nearly five year old male giant panda and Xin Bao, a nearly
                four year old female. Unfortunately both pandas will be spending the next several weeks getting acclimated to their new home
                and won't be viewable to the public during this time. They will be closely monitored by expert wildlife
                health and care teams who will determine when they are ready to meet the public.</p> <br>
