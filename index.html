            The San Diego Zoo sits on 100 acres of Balboa Park, it houses over 12,000 animals 
            of more than 680 species and subspecies. The San Diego Zoo is the most visited in the United States.
            Travelers have cited it as one of the best zoos in the world. This time of year the zoo is 
            doing summer nights, where the zoo stays open later than usual with actors walking around and special 
            preformances happening in certain locations.
